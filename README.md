## NASSLLI 2016 Tutorial

This site contains part of the materials we will be using during the
tutorial on empirical methods for corpus analysis with open source tools
at NASSLLI 2016. The tutorial will be interactive. Basic analytical concepts
and techniques will be exemplified on the datasets listed below.
It presupposes that you come with a laptop and that you install a Git versioning 
client.

```
This site contains already a case study in corpus analysis that we will discuss
together. At the end of the tutorial, the notes, slides and some extra sample code will 
be uploaded to this repository.
```

The course will rely on two pillars **(1)** the R statistical analysis enviroment
and **(2)** the Python scripting language. A companion tool for R is the RStudio
IDE. For Python, you can use the IDE of your choice (e.g., Eclipse with the PyDev
plugin). I will explain how to install and set up most of the required tools/resources
during the tutorial, albeit for Linux environments.
