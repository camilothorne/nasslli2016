## NASSLLI 2016 Tutorial

This site contains part of the materials we will be using during the
tutorial on [*Corpus Statistics with Open Source Tools*](http://nasslli2016.rutgers.edu/course_Thorne.html)
at [NASSLLI 2016](http://nasslli2016.rutgers.edu/). The tutorial will be interactive. Basic analytical concepts
and techniques will be exemplified on the datasets listed below.
It presupposes that you come with a laptop and that you install a Git versioning 
client.

```
REMARK: This site contains already a case study in corpus analysis that we will discuss 
together. At the end of the tutorial, the notes, slides and some extra sample code will 
be uploaded to this repository.
```

The course will rely on two pillars: **(1)** the **R** statistical analysis enviroment
and **(2)** the **Python** scripting language. A companion tool for R is the RStudio
IDE. For Python, you can use the IDE of your choice (e.g., Eclipse with the PyDev
plugin). I will explain how to install and set up most of the required tools/resources
during the tutorial, albeit for Linux environments.

##### A. Software:

* [R 2.0+](https://www.r-project.org/), with libraries:
    - languageR (English datasets)
