# NASSLLI 2016 Tutorial

This site contains part of the materials we will be using during the
tutorial on empirical methods for corpus analysis with open source tools
at NASSLLI 2016.

The course will rely on two pillars (1) the R statistical analysis enviroment
and (2) the Python scripting language. A companion tool for R is the RStudio
IDE. For Python, you can use the IDE of your choice (e.g., Eclipse with the PyDev
plugin). I will explain how to install and set up most of the required tools/resources
during the tutorial, albeit for Linux environments.

Requirements:
* R 2.0+
* RStudio 0.99+
* Python 2.7+, with libraries:
    - NumPy 1.0+            (numerical computation)
    - Matplotlib 1.0+       (plotting)
    - SciPy 1.0+            (basic statistics)
    - NLTK 2.0+             (NLP)
